In parallel development of the CSV Data Visualizer [url]https://github.com/robrotheram/DataVisulisation/[/url]I wrote an android application that would do some of the basic features of the desktop software, for example a limiting number of charts that the software can correct. This also added in the ability to download the save files from our own cloud storage system.
